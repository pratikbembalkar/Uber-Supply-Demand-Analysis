# Uber-Supply-Demand-Analysis

This project is based on a take-home assignment for data science positions at Uber.

The objective was to analyze city-level operational data to uncover insights related to rider demand, driver supply, and trip completions over a two-week period. Key tasks included identifying peak demand periods, evaluating supply-demand mismatches, calculating performance metrics such as weighted averages, and proposing strategies to optimize driver scheduling.

The project demonstrates skills in exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and the ability to derive actionable recommendations from real-world data scenarios.
